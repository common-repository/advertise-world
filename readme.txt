== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do ad blockers work and why are they important? =

Ad blockers usually come in the form of web browser plugins that get installed on user machines to prevent ads from displaying while a person browses the internet. They do this by either preventing ads from loading from a list of known ad servers worldwide, or they match patterns that are associated with serving ads such as image file names or banner dimensions.

The problem with ad blocking is that many website owners depend on advertising income to make a living, and advertisers cannot sell their products and services if they cannot present them to potential customers. So it might be preferable for a website viewer to block ads for a cleaner website experience, however, in effect, they are actually stealing the content without compensating the author of the content being consumed.

= 2. How many ads can I put on a page? =

There is no limit on how many ads you can place on a page, however, it is good practice to limit the number of ads to no more than three per page. Too many ads detract from the actual content of the page, and of course, the more images that are displayed on your web pages, whether they are ads or not, will increase the overall page weight.

Increased page weights mean slower download times and longer page rendering times. Web pages that are slow to load can be frustrating for website visitors and result in higher abandonment rates. So it is never a good idea to overload your pages with ads.

Some good practices to consider are to try to keep your ads above the fold (visible to the viewer on initial page load without requiring them to scroll), and using larger, preferably horizontal ads where possible, as they generally perform better when it comes to exposure and click through rates.

= 3. Can I create one ad space and use it throughout my site? =

When creating ad spaces for your ads using the Advertise World Publisher Portal, you may be tempted to create one ad space and use this space in several, if not all locations, throughout your site. This may seem like a good idea at first, but becomes a problem when you wish to examine the performance and effectiveness of each ad space.

It is a far better idea to create many ad spaces for the different areas of your pages. For example, you may wish to create an ad space for your website sidebar, or maybe even go a step further and create an ad space for your home page sidebar. That way, when you measure the effectiveness of the ad, you can actually tell how well the home page sidebar performs against a sidebar ad placed on another page of your site.

Of course, depending on how your website has been built, it may not be possible to have such granular control over the placement of your ad spaces. If you wish to use one ad space in an area that is shared site-wide, such as a website header or footer, then you a free to do so, but it will be difficult to determine which pages are generating most of your ad clicks/leads.

= 4. How do I get paid for displaying ads? How do I make payment for displaying ads? =

As a Publisher you might be wondering how you will get paid for displaying ads on your site. During the sign up process you will be required to enter your international bank details. We will then use these details to pay you on a monthly basis depending on the amount of ads you have displayed and the number of clicks received on these ads.

= 5. Can I be both an advertiser and a publisher? =

We have many clients that wish to act as both an advertiser and a publisher. Picture this scenario, you have a product that you would like to market to the world. The obvious choice is to set up an advertiser account with Advertise World. However, you are a little strapped for cash and don't have much of an advertising budget. Why not monetise your website traffic by signing up as a publisher first. The money that you make through displaying ads on your site can then be used to market your own products/services as an advertiser.
